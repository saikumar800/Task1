    <h2>About Me</h2>
    
    <p class="about-content">I am passionate about Web developer, with a strong background in digital media and UI/UX design. With 1 years of experience in creating engaging user interfaces and impactful visual designs, I have developed a deep understanding of design principles and user-centric approaches. My journey in graphic design began with a fascination for blending creativity with technology, starting from freelance projects to leading design teams at tech startups.

        I thrive on solving complex design challenges and transforming ideas into intuitive, visually appealing solutions. My approach blends user empathy with meticulous attention to detail, allowing me to deliver designs that not only look great but also enhance user experiences. I believe in continuous learning and experimentation, which keeps me at the forefront of design trends and technologies.
        
        Outside of design, I enjoy exploring new cultures through travel photography and experimenting with culinary arts. This balance enriches my creativity and fuels my passion for storytelling through visual mediums.

  <p class="pro-cont">Facial recognition is a way of identifying or confirming an individual’s identity using their face. Facial recognition systems can be used to identify people in photos, videos, or in real-time.
Facial recognition is a category of biometric security. Other forms of biometric software include voice recognition, fingerprint recognition, and eye retina or iris recognition. The technology is mostly used for security and law enforcement, though there is increasing interest in other areas of use.</p>

<h2>Projects 2</h2>
<h1>The Blood Project</h1>
<p class="pro-cont">
    The Blood Project is dedicated to improving medical knowledge about blood’s connection to human health, disease, and therapeutics.
    It provides open-access, web-based, and expert-curated learning tools and resources designed to increase clinicians’ hematological knowledge, foster critical thinking and investigational skills in medical practitioners beyond rote-memorized approaches to patient care, and boost understanding of humanistic perspectives on blood and blood-related disorders that improve physicians’ well-being and patient outcomes.</p>
